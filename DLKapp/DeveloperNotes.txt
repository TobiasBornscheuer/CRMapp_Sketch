1. When searchbar is empty no Command is fired in case of search button press. This is default behavior.
2. For some reason the ObservableCollection is never null, even when it is instantiated completely empty and no items are added.
   Seems like this should not be possible, since all C# classes implement null.

   ToDo:
   1. Implementing UI response to the Screen being turned (==> Hochformat vs. Querformat)
   2. Implement device independant UI scaling (device independant units, relative layouts, etc.)
