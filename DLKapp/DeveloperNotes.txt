Bug in MainPageViewModel => SearchFunction:
	The DisplayAlerts are not triggered.
	Looks like the statements that contain them are never entered, because neither the search term nor the ObservableCollection are ever null.
	Maybe the Command is never even fired, when there is no text in the searchbar
